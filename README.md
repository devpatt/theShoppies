# The Shoppies: Movie awards for entrepreneurs

## About

This quick project was put together rapidly for the Shopify web developer intern challenge for winter 2021 positions.
The app is based around fictional movie awards where it allows a user to save their favourite films they feel should be up for nomination.

The app has a simple to use interface that makes it easy to:

- Search OMDB and display the results (movies only)
- Add a movie from the search results to our nomination list
- View the list of films already nominated
- Remove a nominee from the nomination list

## Hosted code

This app is hosted and available to test out at the link below:
